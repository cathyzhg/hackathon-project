# Urban Wildlife Awareness Project

## 🌍 Overview

This project is an interactive web experience that helps people understand how urban development impacts wildlife. By transforming complex environmental data into simple visuals and engaging content, the project raises awareness about the hidden effects cities have on animal ecosystems.

## 💡 The Idea

Most people don’t realize how their daily environment influences wildlife. Urban growth often feels distant and abstract, making it difficult to connect personal actions with ecological impact.

This project bridges that gap by turning data into a visual, interactive experience that is easy to explore and understand.

## 🎯 Goals

* Make urban wildlife impact visible and relatable
* Educate users about how city life affects different species
* Encourage small, positive actions that help restore ecosystems

## 🧩 Features

* Interactive UI showcasing different wildlife categories
* Visual storytelling to explain environmental impact
* Simple and clean design for easy navigation
* Educational content for users of all ages

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Deployed via Netlify

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cathyzhg/hackathon-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd hackathon-project
   ```

3. Open the project:

   * Open `index.html` in your browser
   * OR run a local server:

     ```bash
     python3 -m http.server 8000
     ```

     Then visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## 🌱 Vision

We envision a future where city development considers wildlife alongside infrastructure, where residents understand their environmental footprint, and where small individual actions collectively help restore ecological balance.

Protecting wildlife is not just about saving animals — it is about preserving the balance of life that sustains us all.
